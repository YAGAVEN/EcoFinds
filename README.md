# EcoFinds - Frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This is a minimal scaffold for the EcoFinds frontend as requested (no localStorage or backend logic implemented — intentionally left empty for you to plug in your backend).

How to run:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

Project structure is under `/src` — implement your API calls or state management in `src/hooks/useAuth.js` and other pages.
